pry-emoji
===========

Clutter up your shell with some emoji.  Why not?  You already have all that pry crap mucking everything up.


Usage
--------

set your `Pry.config.prompt` customization setting to use the `pry-emoji` prompt in your `.pryrc` file, or wherever you do your customization

    Pry.config.prompt = PryEmoji::Prompt.new


Games
--------

play a game with `pry-emoji`, because working in the console is boring and a bunch of extraneous characters all over the place is certain to not be disruptive.  You should know, you're already using pry.

    Pry.config.prompt = PryEmoji::Prompt.slots

    Pry.config.prompt = PryEmoji::Prompt.match


Everything is broken
--------

Yep.  I'm working on it.


Your gem is stupid
--------

Alright.
